"Create a Django class-based view that generates a comprehensive school timetable using Google's OR-Tools CP-SAT solver. The view should handle all necessary data, including teachers, students, subjects, timeslots, days, and additional scheduling details. The timetable must be rendered as an HTML table where:

Rows represent timeslots (e.g., each period in a school day).
Columns represent days (e.g., Monday to Friday).
Each cell displays the scheduled subject and the assigned teacher (and optionally other relevant data).
The implementation should include the following steps:

Data Setup:

Define data for teachers, students, subjects, timeslots, and days.
Include all necessary details to ensure each subject is scheduled with a teacher and a student group.
Modeling with OR-Tools:

Use OR-Tools CP-SAT solver to define decision variables representing whether a given subject is taught by a specific teacher at a certain timeslot and day.
Set constraints to ensure:
Each class (subject/student group) is scheduled exactly once per day or week as needed.
No teacher is scheduled for more than one class at the same timeslot.
Other constraints such as room availability, teacher preferences, or student group restrictions can be added.
Solving and Processing:

Solve the model.
Process the solution to create a data structure that maps days and timeslots to the corresponding subject and teacher.
Rendering the Timetable:

Pass the timetable data to the template context.
Render an HTML table where:
The table's rows correspond to timeslots.
The columns correspond to days.
Each cell displays the subject and teacher assigned for that timeslot and day.
Comments and Clarity:

Include brief comments throughout the code to explain major steps.
Ensure the code is modular and easy to extend for additional constraints or data elements.
The final output should be a complete example that integrates the OR-Tools scheduling logic with a Django class-based view and a corresponding template that displays the timetable in the specified HTML table format."
